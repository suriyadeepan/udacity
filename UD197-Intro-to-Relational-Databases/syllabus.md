## Lesson 1: Data and Tables

In this lesson, you'll learn about how relational databases let you structure data into tables. You'll learn about the importance of unique keys and relationships between tables.

## Lesson 2: Elephants Elements of SQL

In this lesson, you'll begin learning SQL, the Structured Query Language used by most relational databases. You'll learn about the select and insert statements, the basic operations for getting data out of a database and putting data into a database. You'll learn about the operators and syntax available to get the database to scan and join tables for you.

## Lesson 3: Python DB-API

In this lesson, you'll learn how to access a relational database from Python code. You'll use a virtual machine (VM) running on your own computer to run a Python web application, and adapt that application to use a database backend. Then you'll learn about some of the most common security pitfalls of database-backed applications, including the famous Bobby Tables. This lesson also covers the SQL update and delete statements.

## Lesson 4: Deeper Into SQL

In this lesson, you'll learn how to design and create new databases. You'll learn about normalized design, which makes it easier to write effective code using a database. You'll also learn how to use the SQL join operators to rapidly connect data from different tables.

## Lesson 5: Final Project

In this project, you'll use your Python and SQL knowledge to build a database-backed Python module to run a game tournament. You'll design the database schema and write code to implement an API for the project.
